# MissionReadyHQ-Mission-2-Recipe-Scaler

This is the Mission 2 I did for Mission Ready HQ - Full-stack developer accelerator course - Level 4.

The Requirements of the Mission 2 was to show and demonstrate an understanding of JavaScript language by including the following JavaScript on the page.

1. Declare variables using let or const 
2. Use of Functions 
3. Use of document.getElementById() or document.querySelector() to change or 
4. display the values/styles/attributes of the original HTML 
5. Use of Events (e.g. onclick or addEventListener) 
Any one of the following 
    a. Use of Loops 
    b. Demonstrate the use of both arithmetic and comparative operators. 


For this project I decided to code a recipe scaler which would be useful in a production kitchen.

What's special about this recipe scaler is that, it has the following 2 important features that's very useful in any real world production kitchen.
- It can calculate the ingredient weights just by double clicking on the total amount field and entering a value. (This is how a recipe is normally used in a production kitchen rather just doubling or halving the recipe.)
- You can double click on an any individual ingredient and enter an amount. The other recipe ingredient amounts adjust according to that. (This is a useful feature when you only have a certain amount of one ingredient and you have to scale the recipe according to that amount.) 

I tried to keep the interface simple while keeping the full functionality. 

I created a JS object to hold the recipe data and used Closure functions to access and update date. 

The deployed web page can be found in the link below.
